/**
 * \brief Manages information about a great circle path that extends from one
 * point to another point, both or which are located on the surface of a unit
 * sphere.
 *
 * The GreatCircle class manages the information about a great circle path that
 * extends from one point to another point, both or which are located on the
 * surface of a unit sphere. It supports great circles where the distance from
 * the firstPoint to the lastPoint are 0 to 2*PI radians apart, inclusive.
 * Either or both of the points may coincide with one of the poles of the Earth.
 *
 * There is a method to retrieve a point that is located on the great circle at
 * some specified distance from the first point of the great circle.
 *
 * The method getIntersection(other, inRange) will return a point that is
 * located at the intersection of two great circles. In general, two great
 * circles intersect at two points, and this method returns the one that is
 * encountered first as one moves away from the first point of the first
 * GreatCircle. If the Boolean argument <i>inRange</i> is true, then the method
 * will only return a point if the point falls within the range of both great
 * circles. In other words, the point of intersection has to reside in between
 * the first and last point of both great circles. If <i>inRange</i> is false,
 * then that constraint is not applied.
 *
 * GreatCircle has the ability to transform the coordinates of an input point so
 * that it resides in the plane of the great circle. This is useful for
 * extracting slices from a 3D model for plotting purposes. The z-coordinate of
 * the transformed point will point out of the plane of the great circle toward
 * the observer. The y-coordinate of the transformed point will be equal to the
 * normalized vector sum of the first and last point of the great circle and the
 * x-coordinate will be y cross z.
 *
 * The key to successfully defining a great circle path is successfully
 * determining the unit vector that is normal to the plane of the great circle
 * (firstPoint cross lastPoint, normalized to unit length). For great circles
 * where the distance from firstPoint to lastPoint is more than zero and less
 * than PI radians, this is straightforward. But for great circles longer than
 * PI radians, great circles of exactly zero, PI or 2*PI radians length, or
 * great circles where the first point resides on one of the poles,
 * complications arise.
 *
 * To determine the normal to the great circle, three constructors are provided
 * (besides the default constructor that does nothing).
 *
 * The first constructor is the most general. It takes four arguments:
 * firstPoint (unit vector), intermediatePoint (unit vector), lastPoint (unit
 * vector) and shortestPath (boolean). The normal is computed as firstPoint
 * cross lastPoint normalized to unit length. If the distance from firstPoint to
 * lastPoint is greater than zero and less than PI radians, then the resulting
 * normal will have finite length and will have been successfully computed. If,
 * however, the distance from firstPoint to lastPoint is exactly 0 or PI
 * radians, then normal will have zero length. In this case, a second attempt to
 * compute the normal is executed by computing firstPoint cross
 * intermediatePoint. If this is successful, the calculation proceeds. If not
 * successful, then the normal is computed as the first of: firstPoint cross Z,
 * firstPoint cross Y or firstPoint cross X, whichever produces a finite length
 * normal first. Z is the north pole, Y is (0N, 90E) and X is (0N, 0E). One of
 * these calculations is guaranteed to produce a valid normal.
 *
 * <p>Once the normal
 * has been computed, then the shortestPath argument is considered. If
 * shortestPath is true, then no further action is taken, resulting in a great
 * circle with length less than or equal to PI radians. If shortestPath is false
 * then the normal is negated, effectively forcing the great circle to go the
 * long way around the globe to get from firstPoint to lastPoint. When
 * shortestPath is false the length of the great circle will be >= PI and <=
 * 2*PI. For example, when shortestPath is true, a great circle path from (10N,
 * 0E) to (30N, 0E) will proceed in a northerly direction for a distance of 20
 * degrees to get from firstPoint to lastPoint. But if shortestPath is false,
 * the great circle will proceed in a southerly direction for 340 degrees to get
 * from firstPoint to lastPoint.
 *
 * The second constructor is a simplification of the first, taking only 3
 * arguments: firstPoint (unit vector), lastPoint (unit vector) and shortestPath
 * (boolean). It calls the first constructor with intermediatePoint set to NULL.
 * This is useful in cases where the calling application is certain that great
 * circles of length exactly 0 or PI radians will not happen or is willing to
 * accept an arbitrary path if it does happens.
 *
 * There is a third constructor that takes 3 arguments: firstPoint (unit
 * vector), distance (radians) and azimuth (radians). The lastPoint of the great
 * circle is computed by moving the first point the specified distance in the
 * specified direction. This constructor can produce great circles where the
 * distance from firstPoint to lastPoint is >= 0 and <= 2*PI, inclusive. It can
 * fail, however, if firstPoint coincides with either of the poles because the
 * notion of azimuth from a pole in undetermined.
 *
 * Memory management: The three parameterized constructors described above make
 * copies of all of the unit vectors that are passed to them and delete the
 * memory allocated for the copies when they are no longer needed. The calling
 * application retains ownership of the variables passed to the constructors.
 * There is an alternative strategy implemented by using the default GreatCircle
 * constructor and then calling one of the 3 set() methods. The arguments of
 * the set methods are the same as for the constructors, with one addition, and
 * the calculation of the great circle parameters is identical. The difference
 * is that the input unit vectors are not copied into internal variables but
 * rather the input pointers are used directly by the GreatCircle object.
 * Modification of these variables by the caller will have undesirable
 * consequences for the GreatCircle object. The extra argument passed to the
 * set() methods is deleteWhenDone (boolean). If true, then GreatCircle will
 * delete the memory allocated for the unit vectors when it is done with them,
 * otherwise it will not delete the memory and it is the responsibility of the
 * caller to delete the memory after the lifetime of the GreatCircle object has
 * expired.
