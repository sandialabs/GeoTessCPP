/**
 * \brief Stores information about the connection between two adjacent vertices which
 * separates two neighboring triangles.
 *
 * An Edge stores information about the connection between two adjacent vertices which
 * separates two neighboring triangles.  These Edge objects are used in two contexts:
 * (1) every triangle in the grid has an array of three Edges, stored in variable
 * edgeList.  (2) at every level of the grid, each vertex has a circular linked
 * list of Edges which define the Edges emanating from the vertex, in clockwise order.
 * These Edges are stored in variable spokeLists.  These two structures store
 * references to the same set of Edge objects.
 *
 * edgeList - For a triangle formed by vertices i, j and k, edge[i] is the
 * edge opposite vertex i. Put another way, edge[i] is the edge that does not contain
 * vertex i.  edge[i]->vj and edge[i]->vk are the indices of the other two vertices of
 * the triangle accessed, in clockwise order.
 * edge->tLeft is the index of the triangle on the left side of the edge from
 * vj to vk (the triangle that does not contain vertex i). edge->tRight is the
 * index of the triangle on the right side of the edge from vj to vk (the
 * triangle that contains vertex i).  edge(i)->normal is the unit vector normal
 * to edge from vj to vk, pointing toward vertex i (edge->vk cross edge->vj),
 * edge->normal is NOT normalized to unit length.
 *
 * <p>Note that edgeList and spokeList contain pointers to the same instantiations
 * of Edge objects.  edgeList does not use the "Edge* next" field in the Edge objects
 * but spokeList relies on those fields.  Hence the 'next' pointers in Edge objects
 * should not be manipulated via edgeList.

 * \brief Manages the geometry and topology of one or more multi-level triangular

 *
 * Manages the geometry and topology of one or more multi-level triangular
 * tessellations of a unit sphere. It knows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the positions of all the vertices,
 * <li>the connectivity information that defines how vertices are connected to form triangles,
 * <li>for each triangle it knows the indexes of the 3 neighboring triangles,
 * <li>for each triangle it knows the index of the triangle which is a descendant at the next higher
 * tessellation level, if there is one.
 * <li>information about which triangles reside on which tessellation level
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * GeoTessGrid is thread-safe in that its internal state is not modified after its data has been
 * loaded into memory. The design intention is that single instances of a GeoTessGrid object and
 * GeoTessData object can be shared among all the threads in a multi-threaded application and each
 * thread will have it's own instance of a GeoTessPosition object that references the common
 * GeoTessGrid + GeoTessData combination.
