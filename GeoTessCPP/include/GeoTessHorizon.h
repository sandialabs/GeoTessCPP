/**
 * \brief An abstract class that represents a single "surface" within a
 * model.
 *
 * Horizon is an abstract class that represents a single "surface" within a
 * model. This might be a surface of constant radius, constant depth, the top or
 * bottom of a layer, etc. The surface can be constrained to a specified layer,
 * or can cross layer boundaries.  There are derived classes for each of these,
 * HorizonRadius, HorizonDepth, and HorizonLayer.  A Horizon class implements
 * a single basic function, getRadius().  That method can take either a
 * GeoTessPosition object or a vertex position and the 1D array of
 * Profiles associated with that vertex.
 *
