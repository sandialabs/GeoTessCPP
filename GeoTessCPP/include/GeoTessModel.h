/**
 * \brief Top level class that manages the <i>GeoTessMetaData</i>, <i>GeoTessGrid</i> and <i>GeoTessData</i> that
 * comprise a 3D Earth model.
 *
 * <b>GeoTessModel</b> manages the <i>grid</i> and <i>data</i> that comprise a 3D Earth model. The
 * Earth is assumed to be composed of a number of <i>layers</i> each of which spans the entire
 * geographic extent of the Earth. It is assumed that layer boundaries do not fold back on
 * themselves, i.e., along any radial profile through the model, each layer boundary is intersected
 * exactly one time. Layers may have zero thickness over some or all of their geographic extent.
 * Earth properties stored in the model are assumed to be continuous within a layer, both
 * geographically and radially, but may be discontinuous across layer boundaries.
 *
 * <p>
 * A <b>GeoTessModel</b> is comprised of 3 major components:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The model <i>grid</i> (<i>geometry</i> and <i>topology</i>) is managed by a
 * <b>GeoTessGrid</b> object. The grid is made up of one or more 2D triangular tessellations of a
 * unit sphere.
 *
 * <li>The <i>data</i> are managed by a 2D array of <b>Profile</b> objects. A <b>Profile</b> is
 * essentially a list of radii and <b>Data</b> objects distributed along a radial profile that spans
 * a single layer at a single vertex of the 2D grid. The 2D Profile array has dimensions nVertices
 * by nLayers.
 *
 * <li>Important metadata about the model, such as the names of the major layers, the names of the
 * data attributes stored in the model, etc., are managed by a <b>GeoTessMetaData</b> object.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The term 'vertex' refers to a position in the 2D tessellation. They are 2D positions represented
 * by unit vectors on a unit sphere. The term 'node' refers to a 1D position on a radial profile
 * associated with a vertex and a layer in the model. Node indexes are unique only within a given
 * profile (all profiles have a node with index 0 for example). The term 'point' refers to all the
 * nodes in all the profiles of the model. There is only one 'point' in the model with index 0.
 * PointMap is introduced to manage all these different indexes.
