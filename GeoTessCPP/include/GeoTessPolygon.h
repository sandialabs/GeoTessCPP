/**
 * \brief An ordered list of points on the surface of a unit sphere that define a
 * closed polygon.
 *
 * An ordered list of points on the surface of a unit sphere that define a
 * closed polygon. Polygons have the ability to test whether or not an
 * arbitrary test point on the sphere is inside or outside the polygon.
 *
 * <p>
 * Besides the set of points that define the boundary of the polgon, a Polygon
 * object has a single private instance of a reference point which is known to
 * be either 'inside' or 'outside' the polygon. By default, the reference point
 * is computed from the supplied boundary points in the following manner:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Compute the normalized vector mean of all the points that define the
 * polygon and call it <i>center</i>.
 * <li>set the referencePoint to the anti-pode of <i>center</i>.
 * <li>set referencePointIn to false
 * <li>test <i>center</i> to see if it is inside or outside the
 * polygon and set the value of <i>referencePointIn</i> to this value.
 * <li>change the value of referencePoint to <i>center</i>
 * </ul>
 * This method will work fine provided that polygons are
 * 'smaller' than approximately a hemisphere.  It is possible to override this
 * behavior.  The first method is to call the invert() method which simply
 * reverses the value of whether the reference point is 'inside' or 'outside'
 * the polygon.  There are also methods that allow applications to specify
 * both the position of the reference point and whether it is 'inside' or
 * 'outside' the polygon.
 *
 * <p>A test point that is located very close to a polygon boundary point is
 * deemed to be 'inside' the polygon.  This means that if two adjacent,
 * non-overlapping polygons share a boundary point, a test point near that
 * boundary point will be deemed to be 'inside' both polygons.  In this
 * context two points are 'very close' if they are separated by less than
 * 1e-7 radians or 5.7e-6 degrees.  For a sphere with the radius of the
 * Earth (6371 km), this corresponds to a linear distance of about 60 cm.
 *
 * <p>Polygon implements reference counting. This means that when some other
 * object obtains a reference to a Polygon object, it should increment the
 * polygon's reference count.  When it is done with the polygon it should
 * decrement the polygon's reference count and delete the polygon if the
 * reference count is equal to zero.
