 * This application illustrates how to use features available in GeoTessJava to
 * execute tomography on a 2D model. This application does not implement
 * tomography but merely illustrates how to call methods in GeoTessJava that one
 * would likely need to perform tomography.
 *
 * <p>In order to run properly, this program must be run from directory
 * GeoTessBuilderExamples/tomo2dTest.
 *
 * <p>
 * This application illustrates the following tasks:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Generate 11 great circle ray paths along the surface of the WGS84
 * ellipsoid.
 * <li>Generate a 2D, global starting model consisting of values of attenuation
 * as a function of geographic position on the globe.
 * <li>Limit the application of tomography to a region of the Earth in North
 * America. This limitation is optional.
 * <li>Trace rays through the starting model, calculating the path integral of
 * the attenuation along the ray path and the weights (data kernels) of all the
 * grid nodes attributable to interpolation of points on ray paths.
 * <li>Call methods in GeoTessJava to identify the neighbors of a specified
 * node. These methods are needed to apply regularization of the tomography
 * matrix.
 * <li>Apply changes in model attribute values computed by tomographic
 * inversion.
 * <li>Compute a new GeoTessModel whose attribute values are the number of times
 * each grid node was 'touched' by one of the ray paths (hit count).
 * <li>Execute application GeoTessBuilder to generate a new grid that is more
 * refined in areas of high hit count.
 * <li>Generate a new model based on the new, refined grid generated with
 * GeoTessBuilder but containing attenuation values copied or interpolated from
 * the original model.
