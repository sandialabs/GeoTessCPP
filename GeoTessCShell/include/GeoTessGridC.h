/**
 * \brief Manages the geometry and topology of one or more multi-level triangular
 * tessellations of a unit sphere. Has many functions to retrieve information about
 * the grid but knows nothing about Data.
 *
 * Manages the geometry and topology of one or more multi-level triangular
 * tessellations of a unit sphere. It knows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the positions of all the vertices,
 * <li>the connectivity information that defines how vertices are connected to form triangles,
 * <li>for each triangle it knows the indexes of the 3 neighboring triangles,
 * <li>for each triangle it knows the index of the triangle which is a descendant at the next higher
 * tessellation level, if there is one.
 * <li>information about which triangles reside on which tessellation level
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * GeoTessGrid is thread-safe in that its internal state is not modified after its data has been
 * loaded into memory. The design intention is that single instances of a GeoTessGrid object and
 * GeoTessData object can be shared among all the threads in a multi-threaded application and each
 * thread will have it's own instance of a GeoTessPosition object that references the common
 * GeoTessGrid + GeoTessData combination.
