/**
 * \brief Information about an interpolated point at an arbitrary position in a model.
 *
 * Manages information about a single point at an arbitrary position in a triangular tessellation.
 * It provides access to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>interpolated values of model attributes.
 * <li>the position of the point (latitude-longitude, or unit vector)
 * <li>the index of the triangle in which the point resides
 * <li>the indexes of the nodes used to interpolate data
 * <li>the interpolation coefficients used to interpolate data
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>GeoTessModel has method getGeoTessPosition() that returns a pointer to a new
 * GeoTessPosition object.
 *
 * <p>GeoTessPosition supports separate interpolation algorithms in the geographic and
 * radial dimensions.  In the geographic dimensions, LINEAR and NATURAL_NEIGHBOR
 * interpolation algorithms are supported.  LINEAR and CUBIC_SPLINE interpolation are
 * supported in the radial dimension.
 *
 * <p>
 * GeoTessPosition is not thread-safe in that it's internal state is mutable. The design intention
 * is that single instances of a GeoTessGrid object and GeoTessData object can be shared among all
 * the threads in a multi-threaded application and each thread will have it's own instance of a
 * GeoTessPosition object that references the common GeoTessGrid + GeoTessData combination.
